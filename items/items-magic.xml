		<description>
			<p>This hand cannon was constructed using materials from the plane of Abyss. In addition to its normal functions, the huo-chong has been modified to both act as a spellcasting focus and create its own ammunition when needed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Add your spellcasting ability modifier to Attack rolls and DCs of Attacks made with this weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Bonus Action, the infernal huo-chong can extend or retract a wooden rod with which to enable firing while held, or be deployed or retrieved.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon can be made to fire while it lacks a projectile and/or smokepowder by consuming the item’s charges or user’s spell slots. It has 1d3 charges, recharging each dusk. When used in this way, its damage dice is instead 2d8 for spread shots and 3d8 for single shots, increasing by 1d8 for each spell level over 1st or each additional charge used.</p>

				<strong><em>Tattoo Attunement.</em></strong> To attune to this item, you hold the lancet to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the lancet there throughout the attunement process. The tattoo itself is always at least fully covers one part of the attuned’s body; Optionally, you can trace and influence how the spellscar appears. When the attunement is complete, the lancet disappears. If your attunement to the scar ends, it vanishes, and the lancet reappears in your space.

			<p class="indent">
				<strong><em>Spellscarred.</em></strong> You gain the Spellscarred subtype.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong><em>Magical Strikes.</em></strong> While scarred, your weapon strikes are considered magical, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with melee strikes.

				<strong>
					<em>Blue-Flame Strike.</em>
				</strong> When you make a melee attack (whether for the Attack action, Attack of Opportunity or similar), you can expend one Hit Dice to replace it with a spellfire-empowered strike. The target must make a DEX saving throw. They suffer the attack’s normal effects and take additional force damage equal to your Hit Dice on a failure, or only the force damage on a success. The DC of the save is equal to 8 + the bonuses you would have had to the attack. So long as the target takes damage from this attack, it counts as having hit.
