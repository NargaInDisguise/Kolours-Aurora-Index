			<p>Yuan-ti were originally humans who transformed themselves into serpent folk through ancient rituals. Most yuan-ti were corrupted into monsters by those rites, but some yuan-ti instead became a new people who mix characteristics of humans and snakes.</p>
			<h4>YUAN-TI TRAITS</h4>
			<p>All nagas share the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most naga are either neutral or neutral evil in alignment.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Yuan-Ti with serpentine lower halves typically stand about 5 feet tall when upright, but the total length of their bodies, head to tail, ranges from 10 to as much as 20 feet. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Natural Weapons. </i></b>Your fanged maw and constricting serpentine body are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, and your target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier).
