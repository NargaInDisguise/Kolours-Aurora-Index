		<supports>KTS, Exotic</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Spoken by those from Kara-Tur who intend to trade with Faerunians. The language is a coarse mix of commonspeak - which is itself a mix of elvish and dwarvish - and KTS, and is only seriously used by merchants and privateers. It has roots in draconic, so anybody who knows draconic would have advantage on interpreting KTT</p>
